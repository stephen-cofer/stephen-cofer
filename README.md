Hi, I’m @stephen-cofer. I’m interested in Free software. I’m currently learning everything I can. I’m looking to collaborate on existing Free software projects.

My pronouns are he/him.

I have coded for a major company in the past, been the main technical contact for a Microsoft site hosted by that company, contributed patches to Mozilla Firefox, and now spend my days writing to fight the injustices in our world.  I also don't like emojis.
